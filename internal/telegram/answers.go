I am <b>curly-notifier</b> bot. My purpose is to provide real-time updates on the execution of long-running commands.

To get the Bash script, type /getbashscript. It will give you a function that sends a Telegram notification when it finishes execution.

<b>Example usage:</b>

<pre>rwtn "echo hello-world"</pre>  
This will execute <code>echo hello-world</code> and send you a message:  
<i>Successfully executed: echo hello-world</i>

<pre>rwtn "fajlgjdlsjdkf"</pre>  
This will probably send you:  
<i>Failed to execute: fajlgjdlsjdkf</i>`

	bashScript = `<b>Add this function to your shell configuration file:</b>

<pre>
# Run with Telegram notification
function rwtn {
    local cmd="$1"
